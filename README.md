This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in SQL queries: a subquery returning multiple rows when only one is expected.  The `bug.sql` file shows the problematic query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides a corrected version.  This error can lead to unexpected results or database errors depending on the database system.  The solution focuses on ensuring the subquery returns only a single row using appropriate aggregate functions or limiting the result set.
